        <h2>GNU GPLvX or any later version</h2>
				<h4>Marcel Ribeiro Dantas [mribeirodantas at lais.huol.ufrn.br]</h4>
				<h3>Why should I?</h3>

				<p>When it comes to releasing your software's source code, it's extremely important to choose very carefully the best license available to protect your rights. Most <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free softwares</a> are released under a GNU license, a big part of them having the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) as its license (about 68% of the projects listed on SourceForge.net, as of January 2006). The GNU GPL, as we are going to call the GNU General Public License from now on, was first released in 1989 and has had several changes resulting in new versions of the license ever since. The last version is the version 3 and was released by FSF on 29 June 2007. These versions are abbreviated as GNU GPLv1, GNU GPLv2 and GNU GPLv3.</p>
				<p>There are other GNU licenses for other purposes than general software, as the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General Public License</a> (GNU LGPL) which is most used for libraries and the GNU Affero General Public License (GNU AGPL) for network server software. You may have seen though, reading the COPYING and LICENSE files of your free software packages, the add of a plus sign (+) after the license's name. What does it mean?</p>
				<p>When you see a software's source code is released under GNU GPLv2+, that means it's released by the version 2 of the GNU GPL or any later version at your option. That means you're free to license your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">fork</a> of this software as GNU GPLv3+, for example. Now that we have it clear, let's go to the main focus of this draft.</p>
				<p><i>Ok Marcel, I got it. I want to release my source code under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2, for example. And well, yes, I do believe in the Free Software Foundation but why would I release it under the terms of GNU GPLv2 <b>and any later version at someone's option</b></i>?</p>
				<p>Of course there is no harm in doing it, but most people (myself included) do it just for the sake of doing it. I mean, at first I thought there was no other reason for doing it, and that's why I've written this draft, to make sure nobody else will ever think it's not an important issue anymore.</p>
				<p>As you can see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#WhatIsCompatible">here</a>, two software licenses are compatible if both licenses allow you to combine two programs (or substantial parts of them) into a larger work. If these licenses don't allow you to do so, we say they are not compatible. When you release your software's source code under the terms of GNU GPLv2, it means you will not be able to combine improvements of a third GPLv3'd software into your source code, since they're <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#v2v3Compatibility">not compatible</a>. GNU GPLv3 incorporates new techniques to make sure others won't be able to neglect your freedom and your rights.</p>
				<p>By the time GNU GPLv2 was written and released, it was a very effective license. But deceitful companies had worked their way around to use free software and still neglect the freedom you deserve. GNU GPLv3 came to solve it and in the future new versions <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#VersionThreeOrLater">probably will come</a>. Releasing your source code under the terms of a GNU GPL license and any later version (at the user's/developer's option) will make sure free software will always remain free for everybody and that your freedom will never be neglected.</p>
				<p>By the time GNU GPLv2 was released, there was nothing like peer-to-peer distribution of software, for example. So efforts were made to make the new version of GNU GPL (the third one) compliant with such distribution. You can read more about it <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#BitTorrent">here</a>.</p>
				<p>But what if a new version of GNU GPL is released and you don't agree with the terms? As it's clear mentioned in the "at your option", you're free to adopt the new terms or not. Read more about it <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#VersionThreeOrLater">here</a>.</p>
